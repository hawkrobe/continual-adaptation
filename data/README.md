# Data

Data is organized as follows:

* `human-human` contains the raw data recorded from our human baselines on challenging contexts (reported in Section 4)
* `model-as-listener` contains the raw data recorded from our model playing with human speakers (reported in Section 4.1)
* `human-human-easy` contains the raw data recorded from pairs of humans playing with easier contexts (reported in Appendix D)
* `model-as-speaker` contains the raw data recorded from our model playing with human listeners (reported in Appendix D)
* `model-output` contains the output of simulations we performed with our model
* `preprocess` contains the contexts we used, and code to generate them
